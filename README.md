### Text Editor
With a wide range of customisation options, our text editor is certainly the major utility. Just like high profile document editors like MSWord or Google Docs, this text editor is like a lightweighted mini version of those editors.

By offering a variety of colors, template designs and every kind of customisation that one wants, you can make your document your own!
